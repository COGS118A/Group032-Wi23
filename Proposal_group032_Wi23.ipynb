        "# Abstract \n",
        "Machine learning has recently become an important tool in improving care for patients, by assisting in diagnosis, treatment planning, patient monitoring, and predictive analysis. Our goal is to use this tool to build a model that predicts the discharge type of patients diagnosed with diabetes. Our dataset includes data from 130 hospitals in the United States, that were collected over 10 years. It contains over 50 features including; admission type, time in the hospital, and insulin levels, in addition, it includes hospital outcomes for each patient. The dataset was collected by extracting information from databases that satisfied specific criteria such as having diabetes and minimum length of stay being 24 hours. Using classification methods we will use this data to predict outcomes for the patients, this could potentially help hospitals to reallocate resources, reduce readmissions and improve the patient experience.  We will measure the performance of our model by using various error metrics like F1 and balanced error rate. \n",

        "\n",
        "Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease that poses a significant threat to human health. It is characterized by high levels of blood glucose resulting from either defective insulin secretion or impaired biological effects of insulin. The number of diabetic patients worldwide has been increasing over time, and data indicate that one in ten adults may suffer from diabetes in the future. This alarming figure highlights the urgent need for attention to combat this disease. In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of medical health, offering new opportunities for improving disease diagnosis and treatment. There has been significant research utilizing machine learning on the topic of diabetes, for example our dataset sourced from the Strack paper <a name=\"strack\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#stracknote) as well as Singla <a name=\"singla\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#singlanote)  and <a name=\"gulati\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#gulatinote)  which provides a good overview of the current literature.\n"

        "\n",
        "We intend to build a machine learning model to predict the discharge type of patients from a dataset of hospital admissions of patients with diabetes from the years 1999 to 2008.  There are multiple different class labels, such as sent home, transferred to another hospital, hospice, or expired, which lends itself to a multiclass prediction model.  Numerous features are associated with each patient, such as their demographics, type of admission, top 3 diagnoses, lab results, and other medications provided.  We hope to be able to predict which patients are most at risk of negative outcomes depending on the associated data, so as to better allocate hospital resources and reduce mortality for future patients with diabetes.

        "Our proposed solution is to first conduct data cleaning and preparation of the diabetes dataset for a wide array of algorithms and model selection.  A number of the features for the medication and lab results have a small number of values, such as steady / up / down / no, which makes it well suited for one hot encoding.  There are some continuous values such as age, number of medications, time in hospital, which should be normalized so as to not overweight one column over another.  \n",

        "We plan to use multiple algorithms with the benchmark model being multinomial logistic regression as it is one of the simplest.  A decision tree classifier which will make multiclass predictions based on the binary values in one hot encodings as well as the continuous values in various features.  The random forest classifier will be another useful algorithm which forms an ensemble of decision trees.  A K-Neighbors classifier may work well for multiclass prediction, however it is computationally expensive to perform on high dimensional data which may first require dimensionality reduction through PCA / tSNE / UMAP.   A multiclass Linear SVC which uses one-vs-rest comparison should scale well for a relatively large dataset of approximately 100,000 data points and 100+ features after one hot encoding.  Cross validation and hyperparameter grid search will also be used to find the most optimal model for each algorithm.  "
